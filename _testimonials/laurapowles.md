Many of the more confusing language features are covered in-depth in a
way that's unlikely to go out of date, and a lot of what you'll learn
will help you in other programming languages as well. This book is
fairly dense, but by the end you should be ready to tackle real-world
projects in a way that might feel intimidating right now. Overall, it's
a must-buy for anyone who wants to take their rust knowledge from
dabbling to professional.
