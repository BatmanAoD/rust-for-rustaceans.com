This is a great book, advancing your knowledge beyond all of the
beginner books. [â€¦] "Rust for Rustaceans" is just what we need
next, a book that covers numerous intermediate topics in a coherent and
instructive way. It shows not the mechanics of the language as beginner
books do, but the hows and whys of how to actually use Rust, how to
think about writing code in Rust, and how to understand how to work with
Rust.
