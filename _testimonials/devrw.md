It's a very dense book. It's light on code, no pictures. Top to bottom
of just text. It doesn't have projects to follow along with, you don't
build anything, you don't have practice exercises. I think it's
important to note that before anyone get this book. [&helip;]

All said, it's a great book and one of the very few programming-related
book I've ever completely read from front to back.
