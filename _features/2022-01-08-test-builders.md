A while ago, Julio Merino proposed [using the builder pattern to define
test
scenarios](https://jmmv.dev/2020/12/builder-pattern-for-tests.html),
which I think is a _great_ idea. In a future edition of the book I'd
probably include a section in the testing chapter on "test patterns",
where that strategy would certainly feature.
